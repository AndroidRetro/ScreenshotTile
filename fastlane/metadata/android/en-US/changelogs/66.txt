There is a new option in the app settings to choose which buttons will appear below the notification after a screenshot.
Up to three buttons can be selected. The default buttons are "Share", "Edit" and "Delete". The new buttons "Rename" and "Details" are disabled by default.
"Rename" allows you to rename the file directly in the notification. "Details" opens a preview of the screenshot and options to rename, delete, etc. the screenshot.
